<h1>Telco Customer Churn Prediction Web App</h1>
This project guides you through the complete process of developing a predictive web application for customer churn in the telecom industry. The repository covers:

**1.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
Dive deep into the data to understand trends, identify key features, and uncover insights about customer churn.

**2.Model Building:**
Develop and evaluate machine learning models using scikit-learn. The process includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training (with techniques like dummy encoding and handling imbalanced data) to achieve high prediction accuracy.

**3.Web App Building:**
Build a user-friendly Flask web application that allows users to input customer details and receive real-time churn predictions with smooth animations and modern design.

Feel free to explore the code, learn from the end-to-end workflow, and contribute to the project!
