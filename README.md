<h1>Telco Customer Churn Prediction Web App</h1>
This project guides you through the complete process of developing a predictive web application for customer churn in the telecom industry. It covers three major stages:


**1.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
Dive deep into the dataset to understand trends, identify key features, and uncover insights about customer churn. This analysis helps in understanding the underlying factors contributing to churn and informs the feature engineering process.

**2.Model Building:**
Develop and evaluate machine learning models using scikit-learn. The process includes:

**3.Data preprocessing and feature engineering (e.g., dummy encoding, handling imbalanced data)**
Training various models to achieve high prediction accuracy
Evaluating models using appropriate metrics to select the best performing model

**4.Web App Development:**
Build a user-friendly Flask web application that:

**5.Allows users to input customer details**
Provides real-time churn predictions with confidence scores
Features smooth animations and a modern, responsive design for an engaging user experience
Explore the code to learn from the end-to-end workflowâ€”from data analysis and model development to building and deploying a predictive web app.

**Live Demo:**
